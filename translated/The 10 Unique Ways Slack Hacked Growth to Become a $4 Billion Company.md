> “Life is too short to do mediocre work, and it is definitely too short to build shitty things.” — [Stewart Butterfield](https://twitter.com/stewart), Co-founder of [Slack](https://slack.com/)

Head over to Google trends and see the interest over time for the keyword ‘Slack’.

_Interest in Slack as Shown on Google Trends_

It is **up and growing**. In such a small amount of time, how did Slack made it possible?

Let us see some amazing hacks that Slack used to grow and get till here.

In fact, the Slack discovery was an incidental act, Stewart Butterfield and his team were working on a games app called Glitch, when their team realized how problematic it was to communicate within the organization and what an opportunity they had to streamline it. Thus, Slack was created.

No doubt Slack made it very clear in the minds of its audience about its positioning — defining a new space and then claiming a leadership position in that space. Apart from this, there are some unique ways through which Slack hacked its growth and we are to discuss some primary ones of them today.

### **The Personal Branding Hack**

Stewart Butterfield has been a well-known guy since long. He was the co-founder of **Flickr** & became even more famous after its acquisition by Yahoo. Everyone wanted to know what Stewart’s next move would be, and even before he started Slack, he has had a good follower base. Hence, it would be safe to say that when he co-founded Slack, many of his fans from his days back at Flickr **followed him right to his next adventure**.

One thing to mention here, when you have a smart and famous personality as one of the founding partners, you need lesser marketing efforts to convince people to try out your product, and this is surely one factor that has helped Slack.

Also, as mentioned in a Quora discussion about [the importance of personal branding for early stage startups](https://www.quora.com/How-important-is-personal-branding-of-founders-for-early-stage-startups), most of the people do personal branding wrong as they think it is about being something you are not or by becoming too glossy. However, Butterfield did it **entirely differently**:

_“Look at_ [_Stewart Butterfield_](https://www.quora.com/profile/Stewart-Butterfield) _from Slack for a good example as to how to do it right. I’ve rarely seen of a founder’s personal brand shining through like his honesty and candor. He swears, he has bombast but has not changed who he is or how he looks.” — Ed Zitron_

### **最佳时机**

随着人们在工作和其它事情上对互联网的依赖越来越重，发送和处理邮件消耗了越来越多的时间。然而，这对我们的工作来说并没有特别大的意义，反而让我们得了**收件箱恐惧症**

_我们大部分人的收件箱看起来可能是上面这样的_

Slack找到了一个**非常棒的机会**，它可以帮助人们减轻处理邮件的负担，或者找到一种比邮件更好的沟通方式或者做项目管理的方式。这个为电子邮件寻找一个快速、可靠并且有用的替代者的时机非常完美，Slack可以说是在**最佳时机**进入了这个市场。当你领先其它对手，并且带着可靠的产品进入这样一个市场，你将会领先，并且获取**先发优势**。

_也可以这么说，Slack没有想要去顶替市场上已经有的项目管理工具，如Teamwork，Asana或Trello，而是提供了集成大量类似的项目管理工具的方式（目前还没有集成Teamwork）。这是一种很聪明的做法，这样其它的工具厂商不会认为Slack是一个竞争对手，而是更像一个'推动者'。如果Slack不是以这种方式出现，那么它进入市场的时机就不是那么好了，不过换句话讲，如果是那样的话，它的产品形态跟它现在的样子也会有很大的不同。_

### **设计和体验**

Slack一直非常专注于确保其网站和客户端的外观和感觉能够让它的用户之间的**沟通顺畅**。他们的主要动机是使产品足够直观，使用户无需任何指南或产品教程即可使用它。如果你还没有用过Slack，你可以试用一下，你会发现你不需要一个详细的使用手册，就可以像一个专家一样使用它了。

**_如何做到这点？_**

Stewart Butterfield聘请了Andrew Wilkinson经营的设计公司MetaLab。Andrew写了一篇文章介绍Slack设计原则（或者我们应该说设计信仰），你可以在这里阅读[Slack’s secret sauce](https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce-5c5ec7117908).

### **免费模式**

价格对于SAAS公司来说毫无疑问是最关键的，感谢现在的技术，提供试用或一些免费的功能给用户以吸引他们的注意力变得非常容易。

对于很多人来说，在线购买变得风险很低，他们也想在真正付款前看看你的产品的功能是不是真的能满足他们的需求。

Slack的免费模式让它能够非常简易且恰当的让用户不用支付任何钱来试用它的功能。它的价格策略非常的简单直接。

可以看出，免费版是**功能非常丰富**的，并且它不像其它很多产品需要你在试用的时候输入信息卡信息，用户只要**下载并开始使用它**就可以了。

### **Minimal Features Hack**

Since the beginning, Slack didn’t focus on too many features, and they just wanted to be the best in what they were building with one or two main benefits.

If you are a part of any channel/group on Slack, you want to know **what’s happening within the team** and the **general status of things** immediately. You can **tag any of your colleague**s and direct your message to him/her, and for some reason, the notifications on a Slack create **a sense of urgency** which is harder to ignore as compared to incoming emails.

### **Word of Mouth Marketing Hacks**

While it is easy to be lost in the maze of online marketing technologies, it is interesting that Slack has proven the fact that word of mouth marketing still works. People still believe something that other people (such as their friends or colleagues) tell them.

Butterfield himself used to share a lot of articles and news about Slack on social media channels as well as with his immediate friend so as to know what they think. Some of his friends were entrepreneurs, and hence startups started trying out Slack, and word of mouth helped Slack. As a result, the number of startups using Slack started growing immediately. Many influential companies started using Slack and spreading the word about it and this boosted others to try Slack.

This tweet was by Slack investor Marc Andreessen on August 2014 about the Slack’s word of mouth growth.

### **User Feedback Hack**

Slack gave importance to pull marketing rather than a push marketing strategy. It started becoming too serious about its early customer comments, feedbacks and hence did a lot of A/B testing, focus group surveys, and this helped Slack to build what people wanted.

Slack is one company that carefully listens to what their customers are saying about their product, making active listening the core competency, they try to solve every problem their customers encounter, and this process is in place even now.

### **Twitter Hack**

Twitter is one social network Slack is heavily dependent on to interact with its customers and fans. You can see that by the incredible number of tweets and replies by Slack. Slack in its early stage as a startup knew the importance of customer engagement and brilliantly started using Twitter as one of their social channels other than YouTube to share stories of people and companies using Slack.

Joined on March 2013, Slack interacts with its audience in numerous ways. Slack has an incredible follower base of 297k with 147k total tweets as of now (at the time when this article was being written). Slack always has believed in the word of mouth marketing, but it 2015 it took it up a notch when it created another twitter account for showcasing tweets from the people who like and tweet to Slack showing their appreciation for the service. It created a huge buzz and benefitted Slack for sure.

### **Referral Loop Hack**

One thing that differentiates Slack is its referral hack; anybody can create their community around their interest and invite people around the world. While, many other services give you this opportunity, But you need to follow a particular set of rules and regulations to create your community, and most of the times it will not be free. Slack has an advantage here, to build community for free and refer anyone without any harder rules to follow. Every company now is shifting from their home built communication channel to Slack because of it’s easy to invite and chat option.

As [mentioned in TNW](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/24/slack-is-quietly-unintentionally-killing-irc/#.tnw_oJAigD0o), not only does Slack has communities around different interests (such as startups, music, design) but communities based elsewhere are moving to Slack. For instance, [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/), the community behind WordPress’ open-source software, [abandoned its IRC channel and shifted to Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/), citing that IRC is complicated and unfriendly. Easy referral process is one thing that has helped Slack to grow its user base.

### **Integrations Hack**

If you have noticed one thing, Slack has this unique feature of easily integrating with any app, and in particular, with those apps that startups mostly use, and hence many startup companies find Slack a very useful tool they require to streamline their communication within the organization.

There are so many categories of apps you can integrate with Slack. Analytics, Sales, Customer service, Developer tools, HR, Marketing, Social Media, etc

Slack is also one of the most important tools to do DevOps (a software development practice) since it can be integrated well with any developer tool and it helps increase the organization’s productivity through collaboration.

App integrations can become one of the best growth hacking strategy for companies when carried out properly. **_For example_**, you can integrate Slack with Asana, an application designed to help teams track their work and with this integration, you can quickly receive updates in Slack when a task is created, completed, or commented and this helps you can easily track the progress of any project in your organization.
