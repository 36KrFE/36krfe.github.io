> “Life is too short to do mediocre work, and it is definitely too short to build shitty things.” — [Stewart Butterfield](https://twitter.com/stewart), Co-founder of [Slack](https://slack.com/)

Head over to Google trends and see the interest over time for the keyword ‘Slack’.

_Interest in Slack as Shown on Google Trends_

It is **up and growing**. In such a small amount of time, how did Slack made it possible?

Let us see some amazing hacks that Slack used to grow and get till here.

This is the DAU (Daily Active Users) chart of Slack

In fact, the Slack discovery was an incidental act, Stewart Butterfield and his team were working on a games app called Glitch, when their team realized how problematic it was to communicate within the organization and what an opportunity they had to streamline it. Thus, Slack was created.

No doubt Slack made it very clear in the minds of its audience about its positioning — defining a new space and then claiming a leadership position in that space. Apart from this, there are some unique ways through which Slack hacked its growth and we are to discuss some primary ones of them today.

### **The Personal Branding Hack**

Stewart Butterfield has been a well-known guy since long. He was the co-founder of **Flickr** & became even more famous after its acquisition by Yahoo. Everyone wanted to know what Stewart’s next move would be, and even before he started Slack, he has had a good follower base. Hence, it would be safe to say that when he co-founded Slack, many of his fans from his days back at Flickr **followed him right to his next adventure**.

One thing to mention here, when you have a smart and famous personality as one of the founding partners, you need lesser marketing efforts to convince people to try out your product, and this is surely one factor that has helped Slack.

Also, as mentioned in a Quora discussion about [the importance of personal branding for early stage startups](https://www.quora.com/How-important-is-personal-branding-of-founders-for-early-stage-startups), most of the people do personal branding wrong as they think it is about being something you are not or by becoming too glossy. However, Butterfield did it **entirely differently**:

_“Look at_ [_Stewart Butterfield_](https://www.quora.com/profile/Stewart-Butterfield) _from Slack for a good example as to how to do it right. I’ve rarely seen of a founder’s personal brand shining through like his honesty and candor. He swears, he has bombast but has not changed who he is or how he looks.” — Ed Zitron_

### **Perfect Timing Hack**

The **increase in our dependence on the internet** for work and everything else meant the number of emails being sent and received to make sense of the growing load of work increased big time. And of course it didn’t help make sense of the work but rather increased our ‘**inbox-phobias**’.

![](http://p0.qhimg.com/t018c24237dd86e5901.png)

_An example of how email inboxes of many of us look like._

Slack found a **perfect opportunity** for helping people reduce their email load and/or to find a better medium to communicate and manage projects instead of email. Their timing for pitching an alternative to email, which is quick, reliable and useful was perfect, and Slack entered the market at **the most optimal time**. When you enter the market with a reliable product while others are lagging, you will lead, and you will have a **first mover advantage**.

_It is also safe to say that Slack wasn’t built to replace any project management platforms like TeamWork, Asana or Trello since it offers integrations with many of them (no integration for TeamWork as yet). This is a smart way to ensure that these other apps don’t see Slack as a competitor but rather an ‘enabler’. If Slack wasn’t built this way, then the timing to enter the market wouldn’t have been right, but then again, in that case it would have been a very different product than what it is right now._

### **The UI/UX Hack**

Slack has been pretty focused on ensuring that the look and feel of its website and apps ensure **smooth communication** between team members. Their primary motive has been to make the product so intuitive that their users can use it without any guide or a product tutorial. If you haven’t used Slack already; do give it a try. You will realize that you don’t need a detailed manual to **start using it like a pro**.

**_How did this happen?_**

Stewart Butterfield hired a design agency **MetaLab** run by Andrew Wilkinson. Andrew wrote a story on Slack’s design principles (or should we say obsession), and you can read it here [Slack’s secret sauce](https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce-5c5ec7117908).

### **Freemium Model Hack**

Pricing is, no doubt, one of the most critical aspects of a SAAS organization, and thanks to today’s technology, it is easier (and more economical) to offer a free trial or any other free features to get the attention of your targeted audience.

Many customers buying things online can be risk-averse, and they want to test your product to see if this suits their requirements before actually considering to start paying for it.

Slack’s freemium model makes it super-easy and ideal for people to try without any initial payments. Their pricing policy is simple and straight.

As you can see, the free plan is **pretty feature-rich** and, unlike some apps which need you to enter your credit card details even if you are using the free/trial version, one just has to **download Slack and get going with it**!

### **最小化功能**

在刚开始时, Slack 没有关注太多功能，他们只是想构建一个或两个主要的优点，并把它们做到最好。

如果你是任何一个频道/团队中的一员，你想知道**团队内部发生的事情**和**事情的大致状态**。
。 你可以给你的任何同事**贴上标签**然后告诉他，出于某种原因，Slack 的通知给人造成了**一种紧迫感**，相对于邮件的提醒，这是难以忽视的。

### **口碑营销**

虽然很容易迷失在网络营销技术的迷宫中，但有趣的是，Slack 证明了口碑营销仍然有效的事实。人们仍然相信别人（比如他们的朋友或同事）告诉他们的事情。

巴特菲尔德本人过去常常在社交媒体频道和他的直接朋友之间分享大量关于 Slack 的文章和新闻，以便了解他们的想法。
他的一些朋友是企业家，创业开始的时尝试使用 Slack，并且通过口头传播帮助 Slack。 因此，使用 Slack 的初创公司的数量立即开始增长。许多有影响力的公司开始使用 Slack 并且口头传播，这促进了他人尝试使用 Slack。

这条推文是由 Slack 的投资人马克·安德森在2014年8月所发，展示了 Slack 口碑营销的增长曲线。

### **用户反馈**

Slack 重视拉动营销而不是推动营销策略。 它非常重视早起的客户评论和反馈，因此做了大量的 A/B 测试，聚焦小组调查，这有助于 Slack 去做人们所需要的。

积极倾听是 Slack 的核心竞争力，认真倾听顾客对他们产品的看法，试图解决客户遇到的每一个问题，而且非常到位。

### **推特**

Slack 与客户和粉丝的互动很大程度上依赖于推特。你可以通过 Slack 在推特上的回复数量看出这一点。 在创立公司的初期阶段，Slack 就知道客户参与的重要性，并且聪明的把推特作为 YouTube 以外的社交渠道，来分享使用 Slack 的用户和公司的故事。

从2013年3月加入后，Slack 以多种方式与用户互动。 截止到目前（写这篇文章时），Slack 拥有147K的推文和297K的关注人数。 Slack总是相信口碑营销，在2015年，它创建了另一个推特帐户，展示了喜欢 Slack 并发消息给Slack表示感谢的人们的推特，这个帐户占据了一席之地。可以肯定的是，这引起了了巨大的热议，Slack 并从中获益。

### **Referral Loop Hack**

One thing that differentiates Slack is its referral hack; anybody can create their community around their interest and invite people around the world. While, many other services give you this opportunity, But you need to follow a particular set of rules and regulations to create your community, and most of the times it will not be free. Slack has an advantage here, to build community for free and refer anyone without any harder rules to follow. Every company now is shifting from their home built communication channel to Slack because of it’s easy to invite and chat option.

As [mentioned in TNW](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/03/24/slack-is-quietly-unintentionally-killing-irc/#.tnw_oJAigD0o), not only does Slack has communities around different interests (such as startups, music, design) but communities based elsewhere are moving to Slack. For instance, [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/), the community behind WordPress’ open-source software, [abandoned its IRC channel and shifted to Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/), citing that IRC is complicated and unfriendly. Easy referral process is one thing that has helped Slack to grow its user base.

### **Integrations Hack**

If you have noticed one thing, Slack has this unique feature of easily integrating with any app, and in particular, with those apps that startups mostly use, and hence many startup companies find Slack a very useful tool they require to streamline their communication within the organization.

There are so many categories of apps you can integrate with Slack. Analytics, Sales, Customer service, Developer tools, HR, Marketing, Social Media, etc

Slack is also one of the most important tools to do DevOps (a software development practice) since it can be integrated well with any developer tool and it helps increase the organization’s productivity through collaboration.

App integrations can become one of the best growth hacking strategy for companies when carried out properly. **_For example_**, you can integrate Slack with Asana, an application designed to help teams track their work and with this integration, you can quickly receive updates in Slack when a task is created, completed, or commented and this helps you can easily track the progress of any project in your organization.
