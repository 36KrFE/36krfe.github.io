一个有趣的事实是：[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/d13a8e32-0870-49cb-9b0d-ba0e34fa6561/entry/Which_Are_The_Best_Programming_Languages_to_Learn_in_2017?lang=en)发表的2017年最值得学习编程语言名单中，JavaScript榜上有名。正是这位IT巨头指出，**JS在网站中惊人地达到94.4％的使用率**，而且“不太可能降低”。JavaScript能确保“对用户非常友好的网页，因为它负责整个web界面，包括动画和交互”。不管你怎么看，JavaScript很重要。

这也指明了潜在Web开发人员的方向：如果你正要进入前端，你必须在某些时刻面对JavaScript。并且[正确的开发指南](https://hackernoon.com/a-map-to-modern-javascript-development-2017-16d9eb86309c)可能有助于此。

让我们假设你知道JavaScript基础知识。纯JS（不是一无所知）的那种。如果论断是对的（意思是你了解基础），你可能有兴趣更多地学习**现代JavaScript框架们**。这些概念通常带有预置的函数和一些构建应用程序的方法。

有些人可能会局限的考虑，世界上大多数编程人员更喜欢使用框架（不要将它们与库混淆），因为它们使工作更容易，更快速，而且通常情况更可靠。

好吧！说完这些，现在是深入挖掘的时候了。

我们的开发团队准备了他们每天使用的框架清单。虽然周围肯定有[更多的JavaScript框架](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks)，这些是我们最关注的。

下面，你会看到我们所爱的技术及其各自的特点作简单概述。

## 大街上的酷小孩－Vue.js。

![Vue.js JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_vue_js-1120x560.jpeg)

这个就像一个还读高中的超级巨星。Ta不是一个成熟的技术，所以我们真的不能说，五年后，Vue会发生什么。然而目前，它是每个可能的会议议程中**最显着的主题之一**。

如果你决定和JS极客喝两杯，他会谈论Vue。如果Vue是个流行歌星，那么现在Ta就是最红的。如果...嗯，你明白这意思。

它由尤雨溪首次成立于2014年2月。在2016年，Vue.js拥有惊人的[89％的开发人员满意度评估](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/)，目前是[GitHub中star最多的项目之一](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=stars%3A%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories)。

虚的说差不多该来点实际的。什么是Vue.js？首先，它是本文中讨论的所有JavaScript框架中最快最小的那个。Ta的**语法和原理不需要太多的学习成本**。此外，Ta还具有高覆盖率的文档。你想要执行的操作绝大部分情况已被记录在案。另一方面，如果一个操作没有文档记录，你很少有机会在线查找解决方案，因为Vue不如Angular或React那么受欢迎。

_注意：Vue的发音和“view”一样。_

## 随便挑5个Vue.js的特性说一下：

*   **便于扩展的插件系统。**

*   **有能服务端渲染的库(Nuxt.js)。**

*   **支持范围样式。**

*   **有一个CLI工具，允许你通过先进的前端工作流设置，快速构建单页应用程序。**

*   **在Laravel 5.4的更新用于处理前端模板。**

就像React一样，**Vue.js仅处理视图层**。这样，Ta可以让开发人员实现自己的业务逻辑。Ta也有被称为Flux架构实现的Vuex。作为我们的队友，36Kr某员工说：

> 在我看来，Vuex比React的Redux更好，更容易使用。

此外，Vue.js是Chrome的最佳开发人员工具之一，Weex（一个React Native的竞争对手）也使用Vue的语法，实现用JavaScript构建原生移动应用。值得注意的是，**Weex并不太完善，特别是商业项目**。目前，Ta更多的是一个方案而不是一种实际的技术。

**对开发者来说，Vue.js的点在于：**

*   易于学习和理解，能快速开发应用程序

*   与Laravel集成，所以具有Vue知识的开发人员对使用Laravel开发应用程序的后端团队有所补充

*   由于非常方便的CLI工具，可以快速启动

*   有很多额外的模块，如路由器和状态管理工具；虽然不如其他框架那么多

**对客户来说，Vue.js的点在于：**

*   降低前端应用程序和全功能Web应用程序的成本，在使用Laravel和Vue.js的组合时

*   快速可靠的解决方案，保证稳定性

*   较小的模块很适用，如日历，联系表单或小部件

## React.js. Leading the satisfaction statistics

![React.js JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_react_js-1120x588.png)

Created by Facebook’s Jordan Walke, React is the fifth most popular GitHub project. In 2015, however, React.js (and React Native) were at the very top.

[_State of JS_](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) states that React has the highest developer satisfaction rating, at 92 percent. Together with Vue.js, they are in “a class of their own.” According to the survey, React users are [more likely than average](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) to have experimented with multiple other technologies before deciding which one to go with. 

## 5 random facts about React.js

*   **It handles only the “view” layer, which means that the business logic is decoupled and can be implemented in any way.**

*   **It has a great implementation of Flux architecture, called Redux.**

*   **For templating, it uses a syntax (JSX) that may be confusing at first.** 

*   **It allows developers to use their React.js knowledge to creative mobile applications with React Native.**

Developers also value React for its **ability to utilize VirtualDOM** and the consequent speed of the framework. Often users are also a part of a huge community surrounding the technology. While maintained by Facebook, React is also growing thanks to open-source projects and additional modules. 

Furthermore, **React will be getting a “second life”** soon due to the announcement of React Fiber, a rewritten React with backward compatibility. 

**React advantages for developers:**

*   Huge, supportive community

*   Not a full-scale framework

*   JSX, a JavaScript syntax, can be an advantage

*   Great developer tools

*   Forces modern best practices

**React advantages for clients:**

*   The majority of developers will be familiar with this framework

*   Offers the capability of creating a mobile app using logic from web app with React Native

*   Well tested environment that minimizes possible bugs and errors being produced by the framework itself

## AngularJS. Wisdom of elders

![AngularJS JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_angularjs.png)

Google issued the first AngularJS framework in 2009, believing that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and connect various software components. On the other hand, imperative programming was supposed to define an application’s business logic. 

The actual author behind the technology is Miško Hevery from Brat Tech LLC. Back then, it was created to be the software behind an online JSON storage service. The business didn’t really take off, so the company abandoned the idea and released Angular as an open-source library.

AngularJS adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through a two-way data-binding. 

But while all that might sound interesting, **the truth is that AngularJS is… kinda old**. Actually, it’s the oldest framework of those described here. It’s four years older than ReactJS, five years older than Vue.js, and an astounding seven years older than Angular 2\. 

Nonetheless, it has the **largest number of contributors on GitHub** (1,562), followed by ReactJS, Angular 2 and Vue.js. 

Admittedly, AngularJS has a steep learning curve. That disadvantage is somehow offset by a large community guaranteeing the existence of solutions to a majority of the problems a developer might encounter. 

## 5 random facts about AngularJS

*   **A lot of projects still use AngularJS, so knowing it is handy for maintaining them.**

*   **It provides viable and stable solutions for teams that don’t want to use the new Angular or Ember.js.**

*   **It uses dirty checking (digest cycle); whether it’s better or worse than observable pattern depends on your needs.** 

*   **YouTube’s app for Sony PlayStation 3 was developed with AngularJS.**

*   **It’s HTML-centric.**

AngularJS is **one of the most used JavaScript frameworks for SPAs**, and also is a good option for enterprise-based apps. But it’s also old, and mostly used by older applications. 

**AngularJS advantages for developers:**

*   In 2017, you probably shouldn’t start to learn it if you haven’t done so already

*   Use the new Angular or Ember if you need something more versatile.

**AngularJS advantages for clients:**

*   Mainly used to maintain old applications that are not ready or not profitable enough to rewrite

*   High cost of creating more complicated apps due to framework complexity.

## Angular2 (or Angular for short)

![](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_angular.png)

While it may be hard to fully understand Angular2 concepts without digging into the source code, **the framework is pretty powerful** with a lot of things built in already.

It’s a TypeScript-based open-source web application platform that came to life as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS. Compared to the previous version, it doesn’t have a concept of scope or controllers. Instead, it uses a **hierarchy of components** as its main architectural concept. It also supports dynamic loading, has improved dependency injection, and provides simpler routing and asynchronous template compilation.

## 5 random facts about Angular2 (or Angular)

*   **It uses TypeScript, which allows developers to use Dart or plain ECMAScript.**

*   **It utilizes a components pattern using TS classes with decorators.**

*   **There’s a steep learning curve.**

*   **The development process is fast.**

*   **It has advanced testing features.**

Basically, Angular **gets rid of the unnecessary complexity** that was present in AngularJS. Many think, however, that it still may be too long of a configuration and setup process for a single developer—even with CLI. 

The In’saneLab developer team is also not very fond of the documentation provided, especially for JS and Dart. On the other hand, they do appreciate splitting the technology into a lot of modules.

**Angular advantages for developers:**

*   If you like TypeScript you’ll be happy 

*   Enforces the way you write code, which makes it a good choice when working with multiple developers

*   Uses a single code base for both mobile and desktop apps

*   Good solution for a dynamic single page app with a lot of client-side code

**Angular advantages for clients:**

*   Because of the way the framework is built it may lower the cost for enterprise apps

*   A large number of developers already know how to work with the framework

## Is there such a thing as the best JavaScript framework?

Short answer? No. It depends on the company’s goals, requirements, and final functionality. For example, Angular2 is more like a jack of all trades, especially for big projects. It’s complex and requires a lot of time to fully learn and understand (but less than AngularJS). With JavaScript-centric React, on the other hand, a developer can scrap bits and pieces together to make something useful quickly and efficiently. 

Each of the frameworks represents a different approach to [web application development](https://insanelab.com/blog/web-development/10-mistakes-people-make-when-hiring-web-development-company/) for MVPs, startups, and businesses. 

That’s also the reason why you should consider working with somebody who can advise you on choosing the best technology for your project, one that will not only be sufficient for the development phase but for growing the business as well. 

And—guess what? [We can do that](http://insanelab.com/work).
