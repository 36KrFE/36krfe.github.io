Here’s a fun fact: JavaScript was named among the best programming languages to learn in 2017 by no other than [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/d13a8e32-0870-49cb-9b0d-ba0e34fa6561/entry/Which_Are_The_Best_Programming_Languages_to_Learn_in_2017?lang=en). The IT giant noted that **JS is used by a stunning 94.4 percent of websites** and “that’s unlikely to change.” JavaScript ensures “great user-friendly web pages, as it responsible for the overall web interface, including animations and interactions.” No matter how you look at this, JavaScript matters. 

That also points potential web developers in the right direction: if you’re into front end, you need to face JavaScript at some point. And a [proper development map](https://hackernoon.com/a-map-to-modern-javascript-development-2017-16d9eb86309c) might help with that.

Let’s assume that you do know JavaScript fundamentals. The pure (no, not poor) thing. Provided the thesis is correct (meaning you do know the basics), you might be interested in learning a bit more about **modern JavaScript frameworks**. These abstractions often come with pre-loaded functionality and some way of structuring an app. 

![JavaScript Frameworks](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_frameworks-1120x641.png)

While some may consider that limiting, the majority of coders around the world prefer to work with frameworks (don’t confuse them with libraries), as they make the job easier, faster, and, frequently, more reliable. 

All right! Having said all that, it’s time to dig a little deeper. 

Our development team prepared a list of the frameworks that they use on a daily basis. While there surely are [more JavaScript frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks) around, these are the ones that we focus most on.

Below, you’ll find a short overview of our beloved technology and its respective features.

## Vue.js. The cool kid on the block

![Vue.js JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_vue_js-1120x560.jpeg)

This one is like a high-school superstar. It’s not a mature technology, so we really can’t say what will happen to Vue five years from now. Currently, however, **it’s among the most notable topics** on every possible conference agenda. 

If you decide to grab a beer with a JS geek, he’ll talk about Vue. If Vue was a pop star, it would be whoever is on top right now. If… Well, you get the idea.

It was first established in February 2014 by Evan You. In 2016, Vue.js had an amazing [89 percent developer satisfaction rating](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) and is currently one of the [most starred projects on GitHub](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=stars%3A%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories) of all time. 

But enough about the buzz. What is Vue.js? To start, it is both the fastest and the smallest framework of all JavaScript frameworks described in this article. Its **syntax and principles don’t require much hustle to dive into**. What’s more, it also has extensive documentation. There’s a huge chance that the action you’d like to perform has already been documented. On the other hand, if an action is not documented, you have a small chance of finding the solution online, since Vue is less popular than Angular or React.

_Note: Vue is pronounced the same way as “view.”_

## 5 random facts about Vue.js

*   **It can be extended through its plugin system.**

*   **It has a library for server-side rendering (Nuxt.js).**

*   **It supports scoped styles straight away.**

*   **It has a CLI tool that allows you to quickly scaffold Single Page Applications through setups for a modern front-end workflow.**

*   **It’s used in Laravel 5.4 and newer for handling frontend templates.**

Just like React, **Vue.js handles only the view layer**. That way, it lets developers implement their own business logic. It’s also known for the implementation of the Flux architecture, Vuex. As our teammate, Maciej Kolodziejczak, puts it:

> Vuex, in my opinion, is way better and easier to use than React’s Redux.

What’s more, Vue.js has one of the best developer tools available for Chrome, and Vue’s syntax is used by Weex, a React Native competitor for building native mobile apps with JavaScript. It’s worth noting, though, that **Weex is not really ready, especially for commercial projects**. Currently it’s more of an approach than an actual technology.

**Vue.js advantages for developers:**

*   Easy to learn and understand, which enables rapid app development

*   Integrates with Laravel, so a developer with Vue knowledge becomes a useful addition to a team that produces apps and back ends with Laravel

*   Provides a quick start due to a very convenient CLI tool

*   Has a lot of additional modules like router and state management tools; although not as many as other frameworks have

**Vue.js advantages for clients:**

*   Lower cost for a front-end application as well as a full-feature web application when working with a combination of  Laravel and Vue.js 

*   Fast and reliable solution that guarantees stability

*   Usable for smaller modules like a calendar, contact form, or widgets

## React.js 是开发者满意度最高的框架

![React.js JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_react_js-1120x588.png)

React是由Facebook的Jordan Walke创建的，流行度在GitHub排在第五名。然而，React.js（以及React Native）最火爆的时间点是在2015年。

据[_State of JS_](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) 调查显示 React 的开发者满意度最高，达到92％. 与 Vue 基本在同一个级别，根据调查，React 的开发者较[平均水平](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/)来说更可能已经尝试了结合多种其他技术来使用框架。
**译者注：[_State of JS_](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) 认为 React 的使用者会更多的结合其它技术来使用框架（如Redux，ES6，Gulp等），而本文的原文：React users are more likely than average to have experimented with multiple other technologies before deciding which one to go with. 可能对[_State of JS_](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) 的内容解读有误。

## 随便挑5个 React.js 的特性说一下：

*   **框架只负责"View"层，这意味着其它业务逻辑是完成解耦的，并且可以以任何方式来实现。**

*   **与框架相关的Redux是一个非常棒的类Flux架构的实现。**

*   **模板方面，框架可以使用 JSX 语法，这个语法在刚上手时可能会有一点点难度。**

*   **开发者掌握 React.js 的知识后，可以直接用于基于 React Native 的移动客户端开发。**

React 对 VirtualDOM 的使用，以及由此获得的高性能广受开发者好评。经常使用框架的开发者也是这与这项技术相关的庞大社群的重要组成部分。React 的快速发展，除了 Facebook 的维护外，也要感谢开源项目以及第三方的模块。

此外，随着 React 将会有一个能够向后兼容的重写版 React Fiber 的消息放出，**React的"第二春"** 很快就会到来。

**对开发者来说，React 的优势在于:**

*   庞大且活跃的社区

*   并非一个大而全的框架

*   JSX 这种新的 javascript 语法，也是一个不错的优点

*   相关的开发工具也很不错

*   强制使用最新的最佳实践

**对客户来说，React 的优势在于:**

*   大量的开发者熟悉这个框架

*   React Native 使得 Web 应用的逻辑可以复用于移动客户端。

*   有足够多的使用和测试场景来保证框架本身几乎没有bug和错误。

## AngularJS. Wisdom of elders

![AngularJS JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_angularjs.png)

Google issued the first AngularJS framework in 2009, believing that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and connect various software components. On the other hand, imperative programming was supposed to define an application’s business logic. 

The actual author behind the technology is Miško Hevery from Brat Tech LLC. Back then, it was created to be the software behind an online JSON storage service. The business didn’t really take off, so the company abandoned the idea and released Angular as an open-source library.

AngularJS adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through a two-way data-binding. 

But while all that might sound interesting, **the truth is that AngularJS is… kinda old**. Actually, it’s the oldest framework of those described here. It’s four years older than ReactJS, five years older than Vue.js, and an astounding seven years older than Angular 2\. 

Nonetheless, it has the **largest number of contributors on GitHub** (1,562), followed by ReactJS, Angular 2 and Vue.js. 

Admittedly, AngularJS has a steep learning curve. That disadvantage is somehow offset by a large community guaranteeing the existence of solutions to a majority of the problems a developer might encounter. 

## 5 random facts about AngularJS

*   **A lot of projects still use AngularJS, so knowing it is handy for maintaining them.**

*   **It provides viable and stable solutions for teams that don’t want to use the new Angular or Ember.js.**

*   **It uses dirty checking (digest cycle); whether it’s better or worse than observable pattern depends on your needs.** 

*   **YouTube’s app for Sony PlayStation 3 was developed with AngularJS.**

*   **It’s HTML-centric.**

AngularJS is **one of the most used JavaScript frameworks for SPAs**, and also is a good option for enterprise-based apps. But it’s also old, and mostly used by older applications. 

**AngularJS advantages for developers:**

*   In 2017, you probably shouldn’t start to learn it if you haven’t done so already

*   Use the new Angular or Ember if you need something more versatile.

**AngularJS advantages for clients:**

*   Mainly used to maintain old applications that are not ready or not profitable enough to rewrite

*   High cost of creating more complicated apps due to framework complexity.

## Angular2 (or Angular for short)

![](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_angular.png)

While it may be hard to fully understand Angular2 concepts without digging into the source code, **the framework is pretty powerful** with a lot of things built in already.

It’s a TypeScript-based open-source web application platform that came to life as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS. Compared to the previous version, it doesn’t have a concept of scope or controllers. Instead, it uses a **hierarchy of components** as its main architectural concept. It also supports dynamic loading, has improved dependency injection, and provides simpler routing and asynchronous template compilation.

## 5 random facts about Angular2 (or Angular)

*   **It uses TypeScript, which allows developers to use Dart or plain ECMAScript.**

*   **It utilizes a components pattern using TS classes with decorators.**

*   **There’s a steep learning curve.**

*   **The development process is fast.**

*   **It has advanced testing features.**

Basically, Angular **gets rid of the unnecessary complexity** that was present in AngularJS. Many think, however, that it still may be too long of a configuration and setup process for a single developer—even with CLI. 

The In’saneLab developer team is also not very fond of the documentation provided, especially for JS and Dart. On the other hand, they do appreciate splitting the technology into a lot of modules.

**Angular advantages for developers:**

*   If you like TypeScript you’ll be happy 

*   Enforces the way you write code, which makes it a good choice when working with multiple developers

*   Uses a single code base for both mobile and desktop apps

*   Good solution for a dynamic single page app with a lot of client-side code

**Angular advantages for clients:**

*   Because of the way the framework is built it may lower the cost for enterprise apps

*   A large number of developers already know how to work with the framework

## 有最好的 Javascript 框架这一说么?

想要一个简单的答案? 没有。这跟公司目标、需求、以及最终的功能都有关系。举例来说，Angular2更像是一个百宝箱，特别适合大型项目。它非常复杂，并且需要花很多时间来全面的学习和掌握（但比 AngularJS 要简单一些）。但使用 Javascript 为核心的 React 来说，开发者就能拼拼凑凑很高效的做出一些有用的东西。 
 
每个框架都在以不同的方式以实现适合用于不同场景的 [Web应用开发](https://insanelab.com/blog/web-development/10-mistakes-people-make-when-hiring-web-development-company/)，包括 MVP、创业公司和商业场景。
 
因此你应该考虑找到这样一个人，他能帮你选择适用于开发并且能够跟得上业务发展需要的技术。

而36氪前端团队恰好具备这样的能力。**译者注：替换了最后一句广告。
