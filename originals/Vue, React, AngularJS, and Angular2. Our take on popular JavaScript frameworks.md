Here’s a fun fact: JavaScript was named among the best programming languages to learn in 2017 by no other than [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/d13a8e32-0870-49cb-9b0d-ba0e34fa6561/entry/Which_Are_The_Best_Programming_Languages_to_Learn_in_2017?lang=en). The IT giant noted that **JS is used by a stunning 94.4 percent of websites** and “that’s unlikely to change.” JavaScript ensures “great user-friendly web pages, as it responsible for the overall web interface, including animations and interactions.” No matter how you look at this, JavaScript matters. 

That also points potential web developers in the right direction: if you’re into front end, you need to face JavaScript at some point. And a [proper development map](https://hackernoon.com/a-map-to-modern-javascript-development-2017-16d9eb86309c) might help with that.

Let’s assume that you do know JavaScript fundamentals. The pure (no, not poor) thing. Provided the thesis is correct (meaning you do know the basics), you might be interested in learning a bit more about **modern JavaScript frameworks**. These abstractions often come with pre-loaded functionality and some way of structuring an app. 

![JavaScript Frameworks](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_frameworks-1120x641.png)

While some may consider that limiting, the majority of coders around the world prefer to work with frameworks (don’t confuse them with libraries), as they make the job easier, faster, and, frequently, more reliable. 

All right! Having said all that, it’s time to dig a little deeper. 

Our development team prepared a list of the frameworks that they use on a daily basis. While there surely are [more JavaScript frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks) around, these are the ones that we focus most on.

Below, you’ll find a short overview of our beloved technology and its respective features.

## Vue.js. The cool kid on the block

![Vue.js JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_vue_js-1120x560.jpeg)

This one is like a high-school superstar. It’s not a mature technology, so we really can’t say what will happen to Vue five years from now. Currently, however, **it’s among the most notable topics** on every possible conference agenda. 

If you decide to grab a beer with a JS geek, he’ll talk about Vue. If Vue was a pop star, it would be whoever is on top right now. If… Well, you get the idea.

It was first established in February 2014 by Evan You. In 2016, Vue.js had an amazing [89 percent developer satisfaction rating](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) and is currently one of the [most starred projects on GitHub](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=stars%3A%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories) of all time. 

But enough about the buzz. What is Vue.js? To start, it is both the fastest and the smallest framework of all JavaScript frameworks described in this article. Its **syntax and principles don’t require much hustle to dive into**. What’s more, it also has extensive documentation. There’s a huge chance that the action you’d like to perform has already been documented. On the other hand, if an action is not documented, you have a small chance of finding the solution online, since Vue is less popular than Angular or React.

_Note: Vue is pronounced the same way as “view.”_

## 5 random facts about Vue.js

*   **It can be extended through its plugin system.**

*   **It has a library for server-side rendering (Nuxt.js).**

*   **It supports scoped styles straight away.**

*   **It has a CLI tool that allows you to quickly scaffold Single Page Applications through setups for a modern front-end workflow.**

*   **It’s used in Laravel 5.4 and newer for handling frontend templates.**

Just like React, **Vue.js handles only the view layer**. That way, it lets developers implement their own business logic. It’s also known for the implementation of the Flux architecture, Vuex. As our teammate, Maciej Kolodziejczak, puts it:

> Vuex, in my opinion, is way better and easier to use than React’s Redux.

What’s more, Vue.js has one of the best developer tools available for Chrome, and Vue’s syntax is used by Weex, a React Native competitor for building native mobile apps with JavaScript. It’s worth noting, though, that **Weex is not really ready, especially for commercial projects**. Currently it’s more of an approach than an actual technology.

**Vue.js advantages for developers:**

*   Easy to learn and understand, which enables rapid app development

*   Integrates with Laravel, so a developer with Vue knowledge becomes a useful addition to a team that produces apps and back ends with Laravel

*   Provides a quick start due to a very convenient CLI tool

*   Has a lot of additional modules like router and state management tools; although not as many as other frameworks have

**Vue.js advantages for clients:**

*   Lower cost for a front-end application as well as a full-feature web application when working with a combination of  Laravel and Vue.js 

*   Fast and reliable solution that guarantees stability

*   Usable for smaller modules like a calendar, contact form, or widgets

## React.js. Leading the satisfaction statistics

![React.js JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_react_js-1120x588.png)

Created by Facebook’s Jordan Walke, React is the fifth most popular GitHub project. In 2015, however, React.js (and React Native) were at the very top.

[_State of JS_](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) states that React has the highest developer satisfaction rating, at 92 percent. Together with Vue.js, they are in “a class of their own.” According to the survey, React users are [more likely than average](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) to have experimented with multiple other technologies before deciding which one to go with. 

## 5 random facts about React.js

*   **It handles only the “view” layer, which means that the business logic is decoupled and can be implemented in any way.**

*   **It has a great implementation of Flux architecture, called Redux.**

*   **For templating, it uses a syntax (JSX) that may be confusing at first.** 

*   **It allows developers to use their React.js knowledge to creative mobile applications with React Native.**

Developers also value React for its **ability to utilize VirtualDOM** and the consequent speed of the framework. Often users are also a part of a huge community surrounding the technology. While maintained by Facebook, React is also growing thanks to open-source projects and additional modules. 

Furthermore, **React will be getting a “second life”** soon due to the announcement of React Fiber, a rewritten React with backward compatibility. 

**React advantages for developers:**

*   Huge, supportive community

*   Not a full-scale framework

*   JSX, a JavaScript syntax, can be an advantage

*   Great developer tools

*   Forces modern best practices

**React advantages for clients:**

*   The majority of developers will be familiar with this framework

*   Offers the capability of creating a mobile app using logic from web app with React Native

*   Well tested environment that minimizes possible bugs and errors being produced by the framework itself

## AngularJS 智慧长老

![AngularJS JavaScript framework](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_angularjs.png)

Goole 在2009年第一次发布了AngularJs框架，鼓励使用声明式编程方法去创建用户界面和完成组件的连接，另一方面，指令式的编程用于实现程序的逻辑

Brat Tech公司的Miško Hevery是这个技术的真正作者，当时,它被创建为在线JSON存储服务背后的软件。但是业务没有搞起来，所以公司放弃了这个想法，并将AngularJs作为一个开源库发布。

AngularJS使用双向数据绑定的方式，适配和扩展了传统的HTML来呈现动态内容。

所有这些可能听起来很有意思，**事实是AngularJs已经有点老了**
实际上。 它是我们描述的框架里最老的了，大ReactJS 4岁，Vue.js的五岁，比Angular2 年长了7岁之多

尽管如此，他拥有**Github上最多的贡献者**，随后是ReactJs， Angular2，Vue.js

AngularJs有一个陡峭的学习曲线，这个缺点在某种程度上被一个大型社区抵消，保证开发人员可能遇到的大多数问题存在解决方案。

## 随便说AngularJS的5个事实

*   **仍然有许多项目使用AngularJs, 所以了解AngularJs方便你维护这些项目**

*   **为不想使用新的Angular或Ember.js的团队提供可行且稳定的解决方案**

*   **使用脏值检查（digest cycle）;与观察者模式的比较取决于你的需求** 

*   **YouTube的PlayStation 3应用程序是用AngularJS开发的。**

*   **以HTML为中心。**

AngularJS 是**SPA中最常用的JavaScript框架之一**, 也是企业级应用程序的一个很好的选择。但是它确实很老了，大多时候是被老旧的应用采用。

**AngularJs对开发者来说的优点:**

*   在2017年，如果你还没有使用它，你完全可以忽略他了

*   如果您需要更多功能的话，请使用新的Angular或Ember。

**AngularJS对用户来说的优点:**

*   主要维护尚未准备好或无法获得足够重写的旧应用程序

*   由于框架复杂性，创建更复杂应用程序的成本很高。

*译者注： 各种黑，我X*
## Angular2 (或者Angular)

![](https://insanelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/javascript_framework_angular.png)

尽管在不挖掘源代码的前提下，很难完全了解Angular2的概念, **它是一个非常强大的框架** 内置了相当多的功能.

以AngularJS为基础，使用Typescript重写。与以前的版本相比，它没有scope或controllers的概念。相反，它使用**组件层次结构化**作为其主要架构概念。支持动态加载，改进了依赖注入，并提供更为简单的路由和异步模板编译机制。
## 关于Angular2的5个轻易发现的事实

*   **由TypeScript编写，允许开发人员使用TypeScript，Dart或纯粹的ECMAScript。**

*   **使用装饰器的TS类的组件模式。**

*   **陡峭的学习曲线**

*   **开发过程很快。**

*   **高级的的测试特性**
 
基本上，Angular**可以摆脱AngularJS中存在的不必要的复杂性**。然而，许多人认为，即使使用CLI，单个开发人员的配置和设置过程仍然可能太长。

In'saneLab开发团队也不太喜欢提供文档，特别是对于JS和Dart。另一方面，他们又喜欢将技术分解成很多模块。

**Angular 对开发者的优点:**

*   你喜欢 TypeScript 就happy了

*   强制规定编写代码的方式，使得它成为与多个开发人员合作的好选择

*   使用同一个库开发移动和桌面应用程序

*   对于具有很多代码的单页应用程序是个不错的解决方案

**Angular 对客户来说的优点:**

*   使用该框架构建企业应用程序可能会降低成本

*   大量开发人员已经知道如何使用框架

## Is there such a thing as the best JavaScript framework?

Short answer? No. It depends on the company’s goals, requirements, and final functionality. For example, Angular2 is more like a jack of all trades, especially for big projects. It’s complex and requires a lot of time to fully learn and understand (but less than AngularJS). With JavaScript-centric React, on the other hand, a developer can scrap bits and pieces together to make something useful quickly and efficiently. 

Each of the frameworks represents a different approach to [web application development](https://insanelab.com/blog/web-development/10-mistakes-people-make-when-hiring-web-development-company/) for MVPs, startups, and businesses. 

That’s also the reason why you should consider working with somebody who can advise you on choosing the best technology for your project, one that will not only be sufficient for the development phase but for growing the business as well. 

And—guess what? [We can do that](http://insanelab.com/work).
